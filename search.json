They waited for sales or used coupons so that they paid only $1.99 for a bottle of juice.\nModerate buyers purchased eight bottles of juice, sometimes on sale, but sometimes at full price, so they paid, on average, $3.49 for a bottle of juice.\nOccasional buyers purchased three bottles of juice and were price-insensitive, usually paying full price, $4.99, for a bottle of juice."
